# Principles of Data Analytics Penguins Assignment Respository 

Assignment Work - Analysis carried out on the Palmer Penguins Dataset.  

## Overview: 
This assignment contains the analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset. It aims to analyse the characteristics of penguins using the dataset which contains measurements and attributes of various penguin species. The dataset includes includes information such as Bill Length, Bill Depth, Flipper Length, Body Mass, Species, Island of Inhabitation and Sex of the penguins. 

## Data Source: 
The dataset used for this analysis is available here - (https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

## Analysis: 
- Examine the content of the dataset. 
- Analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different variables. 
- Visualisation including bar charts, scatter plots and histograms.
- Interpretation of findings.

## Conclusion: 
This assignment aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of penguin characteristics based on the dataset, offering valuable insights into their physical attributes and potential correlation between variables.
